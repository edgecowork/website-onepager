<h3>Hot Desk</h3>
Hot Desks are for workers who need flexible access to workspace, but not necessarily a private office, or even the same desk every day. With the Hot Desk plan you can show up when you want, grab any open seat in the common area, and start working. Prices vary according to location.
<h3>Dedicated Desk</h3>
Dedicated Desks are for workers who need access to a permanent desk within a shared private office. Permanent means same desk every day, allowing you and your team to leave your monitors and other belongings. Prices vary according to location.
<h3>Private Office</h3>
Our private offices come in a variety of shapes and sizes, making it easy to find something that fits best with your needs. All of our offices come completely equipped with high quality tables and chairs. Further customization is possible, but must be approved by a Community Manager.
<h3>Corporate</h3>
The corporate plan is designed for larger companies to give their employees flexible access to our collaborative work spaces, providing them with a refreshing and unique work environment. This plan is completely flexible. You choose the number of days a month and who on your team has access to our facilities.
<h3>Meeting Room</h3>
The meeting room plan is simple. Choose the amount of hours you need each month and then book a meeting room in any Edge location. Our meeting rooms come in different sizes and styles, allowing for a wide range of activities, from board meetings to workshops.
<h3>Virtual Office</h3>
This is for companies who need a commercial address but who donâ€™t have a physical office. Additionally, this plan gives you access the Edge community and all of our events.
