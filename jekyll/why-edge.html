            <h4>The latest technology within your reach</h4>
            <p>
              At Edge Cowork we have designed an environment that leverages technology to make your work day not only more productive, but also more enjoyable.<br><br>

              On the digital side, we have developed the Edge Cowork app which is available for web, Android and IOS. With our app you can book meeting rooms, manage your payments, register and receive guests, access perks, connect with other members and much more.<br><br>

              We also applied the concept of smart in the design of our work areas: from tablets outside every meeting room to a wireless HDMI setup. All of our desks have multiple power sockets and USB. We even have spare phone chargers and other gadgets. We have got you covered! And yes, we have electronic stand-up desks, because we know how much you love to work on your feet.

            <h4>Honest, authentic service without the bullcrap</h4>
            <p>We take care of our members. We always go out of the way to make sure you have the best work environment possible. We are not naive; we know that sometimes things break, but rest assured we are working tirelessly behind the scenes to guarantee that everything is top notch for you, your team and your guests.<br>
            Every Edge Cowork is managed by an Office Manager. Our OMs are the heart of each building. They are down-to-earth, problem-solving ninjas who are just amazingly cool. Service isn’t just a buzzword at Edge, we truly believe in it. If in doubt, check out the closest Edge Cowork and meet one of the Office Managers.<br>
            When you wake up every morning and look forward to going to work, then you know you are doing something right. That is how it feels to work at Edge.

            <h4>Save money and let us do the rest</h4>
            <p>Whether you are renting a single desk or a private office, coworking is one of the best ways to trim back on your office overhead. We have various plans that provide a cost-effective option for your working needs.<br>
            We often hear teams say that they are going to build their own office space because it is cheaper. Once you factor in internet, furniture, cleaning, utilities, snacks, fixing stuff, etc., you realize that it isn’t so cheap after all, not to mention the logistical nightmare. Leave the office admin to the experts. You focus on growing your business; let us handle the rest.<br>
            Fun fact: working at Edge can save you up to 47% on your annual work space expenditure.
