        <h2>What is Edge Cowork?</h2>
        <p>We are a smart cowork that designs beautiful workspace for entrepreneurs, freelancers and innovative organizations. Edge is more than just a desk. Edge is a talented community of professionals who believe in elevating their work to the next level.</p>
        <h2 class="margin_top_60px">What is our mission?</h2>

        <p><strong>We believe</strong> that people are looking to improve the quality of their lives by getting more out of their work day. People are looking for more in control, greater autonomy and to experience more flexibility. But at the same time, people demand meaningful connection with others.</p>

        <p><strong>We exist para</strong> to provide people with the infrastructure and platform that they need to do their very best work, and to forge new relationships along the way. Our mission is to elevate the standard of work.</p>

        <h2 class=" margin_top_60px">What kind of members work at Edge?</h2>

        <p>Edge has a diverse community made up of entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers, startups, universities, venture capital funds, startup accelerators and R&D and innovation teams of large companies. Also, Edge has a very international community with over 15 nationalities. </p>

        <h2 class=" margin_top_60px">What makes edge diferent?</h2>

        <p>At Edge we are constantly thinking about how to make our workspace more smart: from the technology we use to the practices we put in place. We have developed an app that allows our members to take more control of their work day. We have electronic stand-up desks, iBeacons, smart lighting, smart refrigerators, car sharing, and much more. However, we believe that being a Smart Cowork is more than just the latest technology, it is about improving the way we live and interact with each other in big cities. This is why we actively host events, work with universities and companies to build the local community. </p>
